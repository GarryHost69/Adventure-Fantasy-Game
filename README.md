A very simple choice based adventure fantasy game made using javascript and p5.js

*Only 12 dialouges exist in the storyline so far. The Idea was to create an adventure game where your choices affect the storyline but I ran out of screenplay ideas, so the small piece of story (It Sucks) that I have created consists only of 12 dialouges, Enjoy.
